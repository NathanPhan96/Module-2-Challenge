    <h2>About Myself</h2>
    <div>
        <p>
            I graduated from the University of California, Irvine with a degree in Psychology and I worked as a Behavorial Therapist for about two years. Although the work was fulfilling, I decided that it was time for a career change and I sought out several alternative career paths. I had always been interested in learning how to code, so I decided to enroll in a coding bootcamp that was based at my alma mater. 
            I hope that after I complete the bootcamp, I will be able to become a fullstack software engineer employed by a reputable company.

            I am currently twenty-five years old and living in Irvine with several of my college friends. I enjoy playing video games and binge watching anime on my free time. I am a rather introverted person, but around my close friends I am definitely more outgoing.
            I am half Vietnamese and half Chinese. My favorite foods include: steak, ramen, pho, street tacos, and hamburgers. I tend to procrasinate a lot, but I always make sure to turn in my work on time and meet any deadlines assigned to me.
